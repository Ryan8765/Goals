			What is this?
		</h2>
		<p>
			I wrote this program to help me organize my life a little better.  I've always found it helpful to plan out my year.  The problem is most people do this, but then don't take the necessary steps to accomplish their goals.  That's how I came up with this concept of split time frames.  Every year I will sit down and and write out goals for the year.  Then I use those goals and ask myself what I could do monthly (or this month) to work towards accomplishing my yearly goals (the "monthly" tab)?  Then I break it down further and say what could I do today or this week to accomplish the monthly goals (the "daily" tab)?  You'd be surprised how much more you accomplish by doing this if you commit to looking at your list just a couple times a week.
		</p>
		<p>
			This creates a way to make sure you're constantly working towards your overall goals throughout the year and not getting lost in the shuffle.  I also use the daily tab for chores or things that just need to get done regardless of overall goals.

If you open this webpage from a different device your list will not show up.  It's not saved in a database online, it's stored locally.

		<h2>
			Arrows
		</h2>
		<p>
			When you hover over a list item arrows will appear.  The double arrow on the right lets you move a list item to the top by clicking on it.  The other two allow you to move an item up or down one spot on the list.
